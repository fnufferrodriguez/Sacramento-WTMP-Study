Name=:UpperSac-Trinity
Description=Temperature model to Red Bluff Diversion Dam site on the Sacramento River and Helena on the Trinity River. Upstream limits are Shasta and Trinity Lake inflows. Network includes Clear Creek (Whiskeytown Lake) and diversion tunnels from Lewiston to Whiskeytown to Spring Creek. Revised from earlier 5-reservoir networkds to add the ACID diversion dam at Caldwell Park in Redding, tributary inflows to Trinity Lake, and to divide the reach from Lewiston dam to Helena on the Trinity River at a number of stream gauges.
